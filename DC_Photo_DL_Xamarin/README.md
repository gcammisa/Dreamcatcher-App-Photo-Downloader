# Dreamcatcher App Photo Downloader

A simple tool to download the full resolution pictures of photos posted in the DREAMCATCHER android and iOS application.

## Quick Compilation Guide

To compile this project, you just need the "standard" Xamarin Android setup installed by the Visual Studio Installer.
In my specific installation I am using Visual Studio 2017 and the Android API 27 (Android 8.1) SDK.

## Usage
Get the "ShareURL" from the "share" menu in the DREAMCATCHER App.
Paste it in the textbox of the Dreamcatcher App Photo Downloader.
Click on "SCARICA".

The download will start and you will find the photos in your phone gallery, in glorious full resolution.

## Missing Features

Currently this app cannot download videos from the DREAMCATCHER App posts.
